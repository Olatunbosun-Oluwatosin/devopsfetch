## devopsfetch(HNG-stage-5 task)

### _DevOpsFetch Documentation_

### _Overview_

DevOpsFetch is a command-line tool designed to collect and display various system information, including active ports, user logins, Nginx configurations, Docker images, and container statuses. It also supports continuous monitoring through a systemd service.

### _Installation and Configuration_

Prerequisites

•	Linux-based system

•	sudo privileges

### _Installation Steps_

1.	Clone the repository: Since it is expected of us to share our remote repository for submission, it is therefore essential to create a new repository for this task on github and thereafter clone the repository on the local machine.
`git clone https://github.com/Olatunbosun-Oluwatosin/devopsfetch.git`
Then change directory to ….. `cd devopsfetch`

2.	Create the main script: The script `devopsfetch.sh` is saved in the devopsfetch directory. Make the script executable by running this command `chmod +x devopsfetch.sh`.

3.	Create a systemd service file: Save the following content as /etc/systemd/system/devopsfetch.service:

4.	Enable and start the service: To ensure the service is running as expected, following commands are initiated. 
`sudo systemctl daemon reload && sudo systemctl enable devopsfetch.service && sudo systemctl start devopsfetch.service`

Install Script: The install script `install.sh` is to install all necessary dependencies needed and setup system service. And with `sudo ./install.sh`, all dependencies are installed.

### _Logging Mechanism_

_Log File Location_
All logs generated by DevOpsFetch are stored in `/var/log/devopsfetch.log`.

Log Rotation and Management
To prevent the log file from growing indefinitely, set up log rotation using logrotate.

Create a logrotate configuration file and the content as `/etc/logrotate.d/devopsfetch`

This configuration rotates the log file daily, keeps 7 days of logs, compresses old logs, and ensures the log file is recreated with the correct permissions.

### _Conclusion_

By following this documentation, you should be able to install, configure, and use DevOpsFetch to monitor and retrieve various system information on your Linux server. The provided usage examples demonstrate how to use the different command-line flags to fetch the required information. The logging mechanism ensures that all activities are logged and managed efficiently.
